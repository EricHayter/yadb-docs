<p>This is the start of the developer logs. Here I will give updates on the
development of yadb after most major changes. The project has been roughly
setup with most of the C++ related tooling setup (CMake, clangformat, etc…).
To start the project, the storage implementation will be done first to
facilitate the IO handling along with the implementation of a page buffer/cache
which I may make a small meta post for in the near future.</p>

<p>Also, an <a href="/about/">about</a> page has been created to indicate the motivation
for the project. Please feel free to check it out. :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“A journey of a thousand miles begins with your first step… but ends with you collapsing a thousand miles away, probably in some desert somewhere.” Dylan Macdonald]]></summary></entry></feed>
