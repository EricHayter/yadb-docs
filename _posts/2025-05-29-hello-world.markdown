This is the start of the developer logs. Here I will give updates on the
development of yadb after most major changes. The project has been roughly
setup with most of the C++ related tooling setup (CMake, clangformat, etc...).
To start the project, the storage implementation will be done first to
facilitate the IO handling along with the implementation of a page buffer/cache
which I may make a small meta post for in the near future.

Also, an [about](/about/) page has been created to indicate the motivation
for the project. Please feel free to check it out. :)
