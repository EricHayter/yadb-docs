Yet Another Database (inspired by the naming of
[yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc)) is a project for me to design and
implement my own database. I will (hopfeully) be using this page to
document my progress in creating the database and also writing small posts
on some of the internals of databases.
